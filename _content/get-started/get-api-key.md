To sign up for Watson Assistant Solutions, contact your IBM Sales team. After your Watson Assistant Solutions instance is provisioned, you can access your instance from the console or through REST APIs.

### Using the console

- Manage your skills and skill sets.
- Manage your clients.
- Converse with your skills using a chat interface.
- View your logs.
- Access the Swagger spefications for your Watson Assistant Solutions REST APIs.<br>

Before you log in, you must create an IBMid and an IAM ID and link both.  For instructions, see [Linking your IBMid with your IAM ID]({{site.baseurl}}/further-topics/login-with-IBMid/).

### Using REST API calls
