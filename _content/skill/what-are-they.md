A Skill is an atomic reusable program for a single domain that allows a customer to experience or automate a task or make a decision in a more intuitive proactive and personal way via voice, text, presence or other gestures or response to a device, like a sensor. Skills are combined and used together within a Assistant application to create an delightful user journey.

Skills use a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) engine to understand what the user says (an utterance) or types. When a skill is registered with the Assistant it makes itself available to help the user with a task. The Watson Assistant service determines the user's intent and routes the request to the appropriate skill.  Requests often are more complex than a simple question and answer or command and control of a device.  For those types of requests, the Assistant service engages in a dialog with the user to address all their intents.

Watson Assistant Solutions uses the same natural language concepts as  Watson Assistant (formerly Watson Conversation). To learn more see the following references:
