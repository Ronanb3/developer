A Skill is an atomic reusable program for a single domain that allows a customer to experience or automate a task or make a decision in a more intuitive proactive and personal way via voice, text, presence or other gestures or response to a device, like a sensor. Skills are combined and used together within a Assistant application to create an delightful user journey.  

Skills use a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) engine to understand what the user says (an utterance) or types. When a skill is registered with the Assistant it makes itself available to help the user with a task. The Assistant Builder service determines the user's intent and routes the request to the appropriate skill.  Requests often are more complex than a simple question and answer or command and control of a device.  For those types of requests, the Assistant Builder service engages in a dialog with the user to address all their intents.

The Watson Assistant Builder uses the same natural language concepts as the Watson services. To learn more see the following references:
