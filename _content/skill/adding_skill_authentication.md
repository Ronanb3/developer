title: Configuration skill authentication
weight: 40
---
You can authenticate that requests that are sent to the conversation REST API of a skill are from the Watson Assistant Solutions service.  In the Node.js skill boilerplate, authentication of converse requests is disabled by default.

### About this task
You can either create your own skill key to use for authentication or use the skill key that the Watson Assistant Solutions service generates for you when you register a skill with the service.

After you enable authentication and register the skill key with Watson Assistant solutions, the skill key is included in the header of any converse requests that are sent to the skills conversation REST API.  For example:
`--header "expertisekey: 1535666c-1777-4ac6-84cc-cf466ae896fb"`

### Before you begin
Create a skill key.  Complete either of these steps:
- If you do not want Watson Assistant Solutions to generate a skill key for you, create for own. For example, use an online GUID generator.
- If you want to use the key generated by Watson Assistant Solutions, register your skill without specifying a key. From the Watson Assistant Solutions console, click the **Skills** tab and click **Add Skill**.  Specify the skill endpoint URL and the skill name. A key is provided in the response.
### Procedure
To enable authentication for your skill, complete these steps:
1. Enable authentication of converse requests for your skill.  In the ../env file of the skill, set `AUTHENTICATE_REQUEST=true`.
2. Add your skill key or keys to the res/assets/keys.txt file.

**Important**:  If you update a skill that is already deployed, the next converse request sent to the skill will include the key.  You do not need to redeploy the skill or register it again.
