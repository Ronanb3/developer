The Knowledge and Rules components of Watson Assistant Solutions power the personalized and proactive experience of your application.  As your users interact with the assistant through your application, the Skill will create and maintain information about them and their world so that your assistant can proactively assist your users. Rules, created with the Rules APIs and SDK, can kick off services or engage your users when the information in their world changes or something you want to act on is created.

In the pages that follow, you'll go through a simulated tutorial to better understand how to create and change information in the Knowledge component as well as create a rule to engage your user.
