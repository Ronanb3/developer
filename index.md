## What is Watson Assistant?
Watson Assistant is a technology that was designed to create personalized and engaging experiences with digital assistants for consumers. It is designed to be easily customizable and integrated into devices such as mobile apps, cars, rooms, and other connected objects. It understands context from history and real world sources to enable a delightful conversation and truly helpful recommendations.

### Watson Assistant is aimed at the following developers:

- **Skills developers** who create new capabilities for their assistant called Skills. Once deployed, Skills can be referenced in multiple assistants. A skill can answer domain-specific questions, such as on travel. A skill can also be proactive and make recommendations based on the context, for example the location, and agents that are connected to external sources, for example flight deals.

- **App developers** who create assistants and embed them into applications or user experiences.

- **Hardware developers** who integrate IoT devices into the assistant. Devices can provide input or output for the end users and process environmental data received from sensors to create contextual knowledge for the assistant.
