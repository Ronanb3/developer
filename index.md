## What does the offering provide?
The Watson Assistant Solutions offering provides a technology for creating personalized and engaging experiences with digital assistants for consumers. The assistants that you build with the offering are easily customizable and can be integrated with various device types such as mobile apps, cars, rooms, and other connected objects.  The assistants understand context from history and from real world sources to enable a delightful conversation and to provide truly helpful recommendations.

### Who is the target audience?
The Watson Assistant Solutions offering is aimed at the following types of developers:
- **Skills developers**: Developers who create new capabilities (that is, skills) for their assistant. Once deployed, skills can be referenced by multiple assistants. A skill can answer domain-specific questions, such as travel questions. A skill can also be proactive and make recommendations based on (a)the context information such as the location of the user and (b) notifications from agents that are connected to external sources.  

- **App developers**: Developers who create assistants and embed them into applications or into their user experiences.

- **Hardware developers**: Developers who integrate IoT devices with their assistants. The devices can provide input or output for the users.  The devices can process environmental data from sensors to create contextual knowledge for the assistants.
